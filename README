Intro:
Featherweights allows the Twitter followers of Suki and Verb, two house cats, to vie for a chance opportunity to play
online. When one of the cats enters the Featherdome, they are uniquely identified by their collar-worn RFID tags.
This event enables the cats to tweet their desire to play.
Each tweet contains an inviting message from either Suk or Verb, a candid snapshot of their entry, and a single-serve
link which awards the first visitor the prized play session.
That lucky follower is presented with a live video feed from within the Featherdome and the controls to a motorized toy.
This Human-Cat Interaction over Internet Protocol (HCIoIP) continues until the one of the participants, typically the
felid, decides it has had enough, whereupon the session ends.

Solution Stack:
The Arduino Uno receives serial input from the RFID tag reader, sends commands to the toy, and interfaces with Python
using Pyserial.
Python posts tweets with Tweepy and facilitates asynchronous communication between Arduino and PHP via an Internet
socket.
All of the above and the IP camera are hosted on a router serving as an embedded system with DD-WRT
To reduce load on the limited resources of the embedded system and local internet connection, an external webserver with
Apache and MySQL is used.
This server hosts the database, PHP scripts, and static assets that facilitate game sessions, and receives AJAX posts
from the jQuery user interface allowing control of the toy.
